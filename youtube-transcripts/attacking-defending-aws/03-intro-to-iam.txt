# https://www.youtube.com/watch/VDe92PyEUcg

00:00:00.080 hi everyone if you've watched my videos
00:00:02.000 before welcome back if this is the first
00:00:03.959 video you're watching welcome to the
00:00:05.839 channel my name is Tara and I work in
00:00:08.119 the field of cloud computing and Cloud
00:00:09.960 security I've been going through the new
00:00:12.840 is try hackme attacking and defending
00:00:15.000 AWS path and doing some video
00:00:17.039 walkthroughs I just finished the two
00:00:19.080 rooms in the introduction to AWS module
00:00:21.640 and now I'm ready to get into the next
00:00:23.080 module which is Introduction to I am
00:00:25.320 identity and access management in AWS so
00:00:27.840 it's getting good now we're getting to
00:00:29.039 the juicy stuff if you have any feedback
00:00:31.119 or questions on what you've seen so far
00:00:33.120 in the video series definitely let me
00:00:35.000 know and I am going to pull up try hack
00:00:37.440 me and jump into the second learning
00:00:39.680 module for the attacking and defending
00:00:41.440 AWS learning P let's see how it
00:00:44.560 [Music]
00:00:52.239 goes okay quick check in on the
00:00:54.520 attacking and defending AWS learning
00:00:56.760 path how we're doing so got through the
00:00:59.399 two introduction to AWS rooms and now
00:01:01.680 we're going to move on to the
00:01:02.800 introduction to I am rooms looks like
00:01:05.799 we've got in this module six oh excuse
00:01:08.880 me seven plot to seven different rooms
00:01:11.000 to get us going with I am the
00:01:12.280 description says understand the parts of
00:01:13.920 the identity and access management
00:01:15.400 service to get a good foundation for
00:01:17.520 attacking and defending this service
00:01:20.159 attacking and defending I am I guess I
00:01:21.960 am is very fundamental to everything in
00:01:24.159 AWS as you'll see when we go through
00:01:26.280 this so this is going to be very
00:01:27.640 important and I imagine going to provide
00:01:29.600 a lot of the building blocks that we'll
00:01:30.920 use in the later modules with that said
00:01:33.680 with the hype Bill let's get started
00:01:35.439 with this introduction to AWS I am room
00:01:37.960 the description for this room says a
00:01:39.759 brief introduction to the importance of
00:01:41.280 I am and the I am module and looks like
00:01:44.280 it nice in the background we got a
00:01:45.439 little some art featuring part of an i
00:01:48.119 policy so we'll get to know all about
00:01:49.560 that and I noticed here we have the
00:01:51.719 option to start our attack box which is
00:01:53.680 great because that makes me think we're
00:01:55.040 going to start getting a little more
00:01:56.560 Hands-On keyboard here and our Cloud
00:01:58.840 details normally when I get into try
00:02:00.960 half me the first thing I do is figure
00:02:02.200 out where I need to be starting a box
00:02:04.280 but for now I'm actually going to wait
00:02:05.840 since this is my first time going
00:02:07.119 through the cloud rooms I'm going to
00:02:08.758 just kind of follow instructions and
00:02:10.160 take it as it comes so task one looks
00:02:12.599 like is some more reading about the
00:02:14.480 importance of I am understanding I am
00:02:17.519 aws's identity and access management
00:02:19.519 service is critical to attacking or
00:02:21.400 defending an AWS account I am is a
00:02:23.800 highly complex service with multiple
00:02:25.400 parts and in this module we're going to
00:02:27.280 learn about I am principles which is the
00:02:29.959 people applications and AWS services
00:02:32.200 that can act on your AWS account I am
00:02:35.120 policies which Define what a principle
00:02:37.319 can do I am credentials which are the
00:02:40.319 numerous ways a principal can
00:02:41.879 authenticate to the ads control plane so
00:02:44.440 kind of catch the relation here right so
00:02:46.720 IM principles use IM credentials to
00:02:50.480 authenticate to the AWS control plane
00:02:52.440 that we talked about earlier and then I
00:02:54.440 am policies Define what that principle
00:02:56.800 can do when they've authenticated lastly
00:02:58.760 here we have least privileg which is the
00:03:00.519 concept about how to create a policy
00:03:02.280 with minimally scoped permissions and
00:03:04.560 how AWS can make that difficult for a
00:03:06.560 developer oo interesting got a little
00:03:08.560 commentary there principle of lease
00:03:10.319 privilege is very important if you're
00:03:11.480 getting into any type of cloud security
00:03:13.360 or really any cyber security in Cloud IM
00:03:17.120 policies we want the principles to have
00:03:20.159 the very minimal permissions necessary
00:03:22.360 for them to do what they absolutely need
00:03:24.319 to do in the cloud and if you hear the
00:03:26.280 term overs scoped I am policy overs
00:03:28.640 scoped I role that's indicating this is
00:03:31.080 a policy where we have given this
00:03:32.760 principal too much permission they're
00:03:34.360 able to do way more than they actually
00:03:35.799 need to do to get the function of the
00:03:37.560 job done anyway I could I could go on
00:03:39.840 and on but that's like a sneak preview
00:03:41.159 I'm sure we're going to talk about it
00:03:42.000 more next we see why is I am so
00:03:44.000 important with traditional Network
00:03:45.720 Centric security you're dealing with two
00:03:47.400 Dimensions you're either inside the
00:03:48.959 firewall or outside the firewall we have
00:03:50.720 this nice dragon picture to paint the
00:03:52.640 picture with public clouds like AWS the
00:03:55.560 network is softwar defined so if you
00:03:57.519 ever heard the term softwar defined
00:03:59.040 networking or sdn that's what we're
00:04:00.720 getting at I
00:04:01.959 think I issue API calls to AWS to
00:04:05.360 control the network all of these API
00:04:07.319 calls introduce a third dimension
00:04:09.480 suddenly we are no longer defending
00:04:11.599 castles from opposing armies we are
00:04:13.920 defending castles from dragons oh my
00:04:16.399 gosh this is getting lit now I am is how
00:04:19.000 ads manages access to the apis that
00:04:21.160 control your network and all the other
00:04:22.880 resources that exist in your account
00:04:24.960 with the right I am permissions I can
00:04:27.160 literally go into your AWS account and
00:04:28.680 do any thing some of the examples they
00:04:30.960 give here with certain IM permissions I
00:04:32.479 could change your firewalls update the
00:04:34.479 routing tables of your network and
00:04:36.560 exfiltrate your data from your databases
00:04:38.960 or your object storage and then it says
00:04:40.880 AWS even has several system management
00:04:42.720 tools that efficiently allow you to pop
00:04:44.520 shells on a machine as a Defender you
00:04:46.919 need to understand how to defend your
00:04:48.360 Cloud accounts and resources against
00:04:50.080 attacks that leverage I as an attacker
00:04:52.759 you can leverage ads IM in a number of
00:04:54.919 ways to compromise a Target move
00:04:56.560 laterally and exfiltrate data so hence
00:04:59.720 the name of the learning path attacking
00:05:01.000 and defending AWS now we say we
00:05:03.600 understand why I am is important you
00:05:05.039 convinced us with your nice dragon
00:05:06.639 metaphor we hit completed and we will
00:05:08.680 move on to task two task two is called
00:05:11.160 introduction to AWS I am got a good
00:05:13.560 amount of reading to start with here one
00:05:16.360 of the core principles of identity and
00:05:18.160 access control in AWS is the concept of
00:05:20.199 an AWS account Amazon treats each
00:05:22.960 account as an independent customer of
00:05:24.560 AWS and each account is its own
00:05:26.639 independent trust boundary inside an AWS
00:05:29.720 account there can be multiple IM users
00:05:31.759 groups and roles so remember so remember
00:05:34.240 I am users groups and roles those would
00:05:35.720 be examples of i principles we just
00:05:37.919 talked about in the last section
00:05:39.880 terminology can be confusing isn't that
00:05:41.639 so true and people often refer to
00:05:43.639 granting access as giving someone an I
00:05:45.680 am account for clarity we shall always
00:05:48.440 refer to the AWS account as an account
00:05:50.479 and an I am user inside that account as
00:05:52.919 an I am user makes sense every AWS
00:05:55.360 account has a root user and AWS
00:05:57.360 considers that root user the customer
00:05:59.520 major customer service interactions need
00:06:01.080 to occur from that root user including
00:06:02.960 billing changes and closing the account
00:06:04.680 I believe these were examples we learned
00:06:06.560 in the organizations briefing before
00:06:09.120 that only the management account of the
00:06:10.520 organization can do these root user
00:06:12.080 actions so this connected the root user
00:06:14.400 is all powerful remember that and has
00:06:16.639 complete control over all resources in
00:06:19.000 the account except for organizational
00:06:21.440 service control policies which we're
00:06:22.759 going to discuss in a future room which
00:06:24.319 sounds interesting I'm excited for
00:06:26.240 that since the root user is all powerful
00:06:28.759 and since there is only one best
00:06:30.720 practice is to create individual IM
00:06:32.560 users for each person who needs access
00:06:34.199 to the account and only Grant the level
00:06:36.280 of access required for their job
00:06:37.800 function so now we're getting into that
00:06:39.199 least privilege idea only the level of
00:06:41.400 access required for them to do their job
00:06:43.880 when creating account for the first time
00:06:45.599 the common practice is for the root user
00:06:47.039 to create an admin I am user and never
00:06:48.880 use root again that is indeed the best
00:06:50.680 practice I don't know if I would say
00:06:52.039 it's the common practice but it is what
00:06:53.720 you should do you really want to avoid
00:06:55.360 using the root user you don't want to be
00:06:57.319 logging in as the root user all the time
00:06:58.960 you should create create a day-to-day
00:07:00.120 admin user to use instead oh I swear I
00:07:02.680 didn't read this at this point
00:07:03.800 day-to-day access should occur via
00:07:06.120 either I am users or IM roles and IM
00:07:09.240 users combine authentication identity
00:07:11.240 and authorization into a single unit I
00:07:14.240 roles typically delegate the
00:07:15.639 authentication and identity to another
00:07:18.000 system and primarily manage
00:07:19.599 authorization interesting I don't know
00:07:21.000 if I've really thought about it like
00:07:22.039 that before let me read that again IM
00:07:24.199 users combine authentication identity
00:07:26.639 and authorization into a single unit
00:07:28.759 okay well that does indeed make sense so
00:07:31.120 your IM your IM user says who you are
00:07:34.720 and what you're allowed to do okay makes
00:07:36.360 sense and then IM roles typically
00:07:37.919 delegate the authentication and identity
00:07:40.479 to another system okay now I get it yeah
00:07:43.919 that is true and primarily manage
00:07:46.120 authorization so roles are more focused
00:07:48.159 on authorization we will discuss users
00:07:50.800 and roles in the Next Room looking
00:07:52.639 forward to it both IM users and IM roles
00:07:56.120 require IM policies to be able to do
00:07:58.039 anything by default all API requests are
00:08:00.759 implicitly denied if you remember one
00:08:02.960 thing so far this is a good thing to
00:08:04.720 remember all API requests in AWS are
00:08:07.520 implicitly denied you need to somehow be
00:08:10.080 allowed to do the action before you do
00:08:12.479 it and if there's no allow anywhere it's
00:08:14.919 denied by default we're going to discuss
00:08:17.240 more about policies how they work in the
00:08:18.759 future lots of foreshadowing here for
00:08:20.840 introductory purposes the user or role
00:08:22.639 is the who can do something and the
00:08:24.000 policy defines what they can do I am
00:08:26.360 policies Define the actions that the
00:08:28.280 user or role can form on a resource
00:08:30.919 let's see where this link takes us to so
00:08:34.240 these would be examples of an action
00:08:36.719 within I am and it says here so looks
00:08:38.479 like we're looking at IM am itself and
00:08:40.799 IM supports approximately 40 actions for
00:08:43.360 a user resource so the user is the
00:08:45.720 resource this is four examples of the 40
00:08:48.320 actions we can take on a user resource
00:08:50.680 so we could create a user we can delete
00:08:52.160 a user get a user Etc almost everything
00:08:55.000 you create in adabs is a resource and
00:08:57.080 almost all resources can be identified
00:08:58.880 by their Amazon resource name or ar one
00:09:02.399 time me and a bunch of co-workers gotten
00:09:03.959 such a long discussion about if you say
00:09:05.640 this Arn or Arn I always say AR so let
00:09:08.560 me know in the comments if you think
00:09:09.839 that's the wrong way of going about it
00:09:11.600 ARS uniquely identify ads resources
00:09:14.000 remember that an AR is a unique
00:09:15.440 identifier we require an Arn when you
00:09:17.560 need to specify a resource unambiguously
00:09:20.200 across all of AWS and you'll use Arns in
00:09:23.360 places like IM am policies to specify
00:09:25.920 action in relation to a specific
00:09:27.920 resource identified by AR tags and API
00:09:32.480 calls okay lots of reading thanks for
00:09:34.800 sticking with me so far hopefully it's
00:09:37.200 remaining interesting I think we're
00:09:38.279 going to get to something Hands-On soon
00:09:40.480 an AR consists of the region account ID
00:09:43.160 service and some identifiers for the
00:09:44.760 resource commonly the resources name you
00:09:46.959 know you're really like a AWS Hardo AWS
00:09:49.360 Pro when you start being able to
00:09:50.519 construct these ARS from memory I use
00:09:52.519 ARS constantly especially writing
00:09:54.600 infrastructure as code like in my Terra
00:09:56.079 form I have a lot of logic that has to
00:09:57.560 do with ARs and stuff like that so
00:09:59.640 here's an example of an Arn it starts
00:10:01.399 with Arn then AWS then the service ec2
00:10:05.200 in this case then the region then the
00:10:08.480 account ID then for ec2 we have the
00:10:12.240 instance ID here as an identifier so
00:10:14.560 that's an example of an AR for an ec2
00:10:16.560 resource here's another example looks
00:10:18.600 like this is an i IM rule so again it
00:10:20.440 starts with Arn AWS the I am service you
00:10:24.800 might remember IM is a global Service we
00:10:27.160 learned that in one of the other rooms
00:10:28.600 before so there's no region identifier
00:10:30.800 here and then the account ID and then r
00:10:34.040 slash the rle name and rle names need to
00:10:37.480 be unique within accounts don't ask me
00:10:39.120 how I know that I've learned it the hard
00:10:40.480 way many many times now oh we got some
00:10:43.240 trivia Arn almost always begin with RN
00:10:46.000 AWS the second field is called the
00:10:48.519 partition so this part right here AWS is
00:10:51.079 called the partition and we learned
00:10:52.279 about partitions in one of those other
00:10:53.519 rooms you might remember most AWS
00:10:56.040 customers are in the AWS partition I've
00:10:58.399 often heard that AWS partition called
00:11:00.160 the commercial regions or the standard
00:11:01.959 regions but the AWS partition is
00:11:03.920 basically like almost every region
00:11:05.680 within AWS but there are several other
00:11:07.560 partitions including govcloud the China
00:11:10.240 region and a handful of other partitions
00:11:12.639 built for the US government so what
00:11:14.680 they're getting at is that the ARs for
00:11:16.920 those other partitions that are not the
00:11:18.720 main partition would have a different
00:11:20.720 value here after AR it wouldn't be ar
00:11:22.560 AWS it would be
00:11:24.680 ar AWS CN to indicate the China
00:11:27.720 partition for example as for requires
00:11:29.320 the use of an access key and secret key
00:11:31.760 and an optional session token to
00:11:33.320 authenticate calls to the AWS apis these
00:11:36.200 Keys sign the request and identify which
00:11:38.279 user or role and which AWS account the
00:11:40.320 requests come from we will discuss
00:11:42.240 credentials in more detail in a later
00:11:43.880 room and I bet that is going to be a fun
00:11:45.600 room if I had to predict multiple AWS
00:11:48.360 accounts can be members of an
00:11:49.320 organization we learned about that
00:11:50.720 earlier as well this is typically done
00:11:52.440 for management and Consolidated billing
00:11:54.279 purposes typically there is no implicit
00:11:56.880 trust across accounts in an organization
00:11:59.600 however ads has introduced some new
00:12:01.360 features that blur the boundary and
00:12:02.839 allow the organization management
00:12:04.399 account to modify and manage the member
00:12:06.839 account oh I love AWS architecture
00:12:08.639 diagrams here's a nice little diagram
00:12:10.600 about what they're talking about so here
00:12:12.880 we're in the boundaries of an AWS
00:12:14.440 organization and you remember AWS
00:12:16.800 organizations typically consist of
00:12:18.720 multiple AWS accounts that are member
00:12:20.760 accounts and typically they're organized
00:12:22.240 in organizational units so here's one
00:12:24.680 AWS account in the organization and we
00:12:27.720 have a couple examples of the principles
00:12:29.240 we were talking about earlier so we have
00:12:30.440 the IM am user which is an IM principal
00:12:33.839 and the IM user has a few different
00:12:35.360 things going on so the I am user
00:12:37.720 authenticates as that user with
00:12:39.360 long-term security credentials I hope
00:12:41.560 we're going to get into this more in
00:12:42.959 this learning path but really the more
00:12:44.560 you can avoid long-term security
00:12:46.320 credentials in AWS the better and it's
00:12:48.320 getting easier and easier to do that I
00:12:49.760 have some other videos about it so
00:12:51.639 that's just like a sidebar plug you
00:12:53.199 really if you can avoid even using these
00:12:55.120 long-term security credentials that's
00:12:56.560 even better but traditionally that's
00:12:58.680 what what a user authenticates with and
00:13:00.399 then the user is also a member of an IM
00:13:02.279 group and both the user and the group
00:13:05.040 can have I am policies attached to them
00:13:07.760 that impact what that user would be able
00:13:09.320 to do so what the user is able to do in
00:13:12.079 AWS account depends on the IM policies
00:13:14.839 directly attached to the user and also
00:13:17.079 the IM policies attached to any group
00:13:19.079 the user is a member of and then also in
00:13:22.199 this AWS account we have an IM Ro and
00:13:24.800 the IM RO authenticates with temporary
00:13:26.959 security credentials which is almost
00:13:28.959 always preferable so that's why I can't
00:13:31.279 remember if I've already said this in
00:13:32.240 one of these videos but I do say this a
00:13:33.920 lot whenever you're taking an AWS exam a
00:13:36.800 little tip especially if it's like the
00:13:38.040 security exam or if it's a question
00:13:39.199 about security if you have an option
00:13:41.399 that involves assuming an I am role and
00:13:43.959 using temporary security credentials
00:13:46.040 that's almost always going to be the
00:13:47.199 right answer because that's almost
00:13:49.040 always the best practice because the
00:13:50.399 temporary security credentials are a lot
00:13:52.279 more secure than using long-term
00:13:54.199 credentials anyway I'm sure I'll
00:13:55.920 probably repeat that about five more
00:13:57.120 times going forward the I Ro also has IM
00:13:59.959 policies attached to it that is going to
00:14:01.920 determine what the entity that assumes
00:14:04.040 that IM role is going to be able to do
00:14:06.839 uh using those temporary security
00:14:08.320 credentials so that's a little bit of an
00:14:09.880 overview I don't really know why this
00:14:11.839 diagram involves the abws organization
00:14:13.959 because this is just more like a basic I
00:14:16.519 am diagram but I guess just to get the
00:14:17.959 point across this would be true even if
00:14:19.360 the account was not in an AWS
00:14:21.360 organization so we scroll down here and
00:14:25.120 once again okay so no flag or anything
00:14:27.279 we just hit completed and there we
00:14:30.160 go okay whoop whoop another room down
00:14:33.120 very nicely done we didn't have to spin
00:14:34.720 up any of these machines so that's
00:14:36.120 interesting I thought we were probably
00:14:37.199 going to have to but I'm sure we're
00:14:38.600 going to soon so stay excited and
00:14:40.759 hopefully I will see you in the Next
00:14:42.000 Room
